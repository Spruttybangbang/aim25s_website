# Django Configuration
# ====================

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
# Generate a new secret key for production using: python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
# Set to 'True' for development, 'False' for production
DEBUG=True

# Comma-separated list of allowed hosts
# For development: localhost,127.0.0.1
# For production: your-app.railway.app,yourdomain.com
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# CSRF trusted origins (required for Railway/production)
# MUST include https:// protocol
# For production: https://your-app.up.railway.app,https://yourdomain.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=


# Database Configuration
# ======================

# Leave empty for local development (uses SQLite)
# Railway automatically provides DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL in production
# Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_URL=


# Google Sheets Sync Configuration
# =================================

# Google Sheets Spreadsheet ID (from the URL)
# Example: If URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123/edit
# Then SPREADSHEET_ID is ABC123
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=ssss

# Google Service Account Credentials (JSON)
# Follow these steps to set up:
#
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Create a new project or select an existing one
# 3. Enable Google Sheets API:

#
# Example format (paste the entire JSON on one line):
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",...}
